 * The Date class provides a basic structure for date and time related
 * information. Date instances can be created by
 * - `new Date()` for a specific date,
 * - `Date.now()` to obtain information about the current time,
 * - `Date.fromTime()` with a given timestamp or
 * - `Date.fromString()` by parsing from a String.
 * There are some extra functions available in the `DateTools` class.
 * In the context of Haxe dates, a timestamp is defined as the number of
 * milliseconds elapsed since 1st January 1970 UTC.
 * ## Supported range
 * Due to platform limitations, only dates in the range 1970 through 2038 are
 * supported consistently. Some targets may support dates outside this range,
 * depending on the OS at runtime. The `Date.fromTime` method will not work with
 * timestamps outside the range on any target.
